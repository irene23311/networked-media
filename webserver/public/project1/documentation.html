        <strong>Concept:</strong><br>
        A digital representation of a physical desktop.<br>
        This project is a collage-based hypertext website that presents objects on my desk as entry points.<br>
        Each object has it's own room, where fragments of text describe use, habit, or relationship with myself

        Click items to see closer.<br>
        Use the "Map" for a linear view.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>
        I started by sketching a rough layout of objects on a desk and deciding which items to put one the screen. Figuringout how to remove the background,  I then built a simple HTML structure with an index page and individual item pages.
